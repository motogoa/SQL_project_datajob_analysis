### Bar Chart

To visualize the demand for these skills, we can create a bar chart:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

# Data provided
data = [
    {"skills": "sql", "demand_count": 3083},
    {"skills": "excel", "demand_count": 2143},
    {"skills": "python", "demand_count": 1840},
    {"skills": "tableau", "demand_count": 1659},
    {"skills": "r", "demand_count": 1073},
    {"skills": "power bi", "demand_count": 1044},
    {"skills": "sas", "demand_count": 1000},
    {"skills": "word", "demand_count": 527},
    {"skills": "powerpoint", "demand_count": 524},
    {"skills": "sql server", "demand_count": 336}
]

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.set(style="darkgrid")
plt.style.use("dark_background")

sns.barplot(x='demand_count', y='skills', data=df, palette="Blues_r", order=df.sort_values('demand_count', ascending=False)['skills'])
plt.xlabel('Demand Count')
plt.ylabel('Skills')
plt.title('Top-10 In-Demand Skills for Data Analyst Jobs')

# Save the plot as an image file
chart_path = '/mnt/data/top_10_in_demand_skills_data_analyst.png'
plt.savefig(chart_path)
plt.show()
```

You can run this code in your local Python environment to generate and visualize the chart.
